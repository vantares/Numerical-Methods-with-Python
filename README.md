    Numerical Methods in Engineering with Python
    Second Edition

    Numerical Methods in Engineering with Python, Second Edition, is a
    text for engineering students and a reference for practicing engineers,
    especially those who wish to explore Python. This new edition fea-
    tures 18 additional exercises and the addition of rational function in-
    terpolation. Brent’s method of root finding was replaced by Ridder’s
    method, and the Fletcher–Reeves method of optimization was dropped
    in favor of the downhill simplex method. Each numerical method is
    explained in detail, and its shortcomings are pointed out. The ex-
    amples that follow individual topics fall into two categories: hand
    computations that illustrate the inner workings of the method and
    small programs that show how the computer code is utilized in solv-
    ing a problem. This second edition also includes more robust com-
    puter code with each method, which is available on the book Web site
    (www.cambridge.org/kiusalaaspython). This code is made simple and
    easy to understand by avoiding complex bookkeeping schemes, while
    maintaining the essential features of the method.

    Jaan Kiusalaas is a Professor Emeritus in the Department of Engineer-
    ing Science and Mechanics at Pennsylvania State University. He has
    taught computer methods, including finite element and boundary el-
    ement methods, for more than 30 years. He is also the co-author of four
    other books – Engineering Mechanics: Statics, Engineering Mechanics:
    Dynamics, Mechanics of Materials, and an alternate version of this work
    with MATLAB code.
